# Multicorner

Multicorner is a small script, inspried by Corner.py[https://github.com/dfm/corner.py] to make cornerplots of widely, spaced multimodal distributions.

## Installation (Python)

It's good practice to setup a virtual environment to install any module. This can be done with python via. 

    python3 -m venv venvname
    source venvname/bin/activate

Now we can install multicorner:

    pip install multicorner

To test if it works, you can run the examples in the 'docs' directory!
